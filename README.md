# Jenkins, Containers & Webservers project

## Description
Welcome to our project! we will show you how to take a Python application and a static website running on Nginx,
and containerize them using Docker.then we will deploy them using Docker Compose, which will enable us to run our 
app and website in containers. Additionally, we will create a Jenkinsfile to 
enable Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for our app.

## Components
The project consists of the following components:

* Jenkins: Automates the build, test, and deployment process.
* Docker Compose: Manages multi-container Docker applications.
* Private Docker Hub Registry: Stores and manages Docker images.
* Web Servers: Hosts the application and the website.
* Nexus: Manages build artifacts and Docker images.
